# Tools for understanding the image repositories

## What is this about
The images (well, raw data) when organized in a strict hierarchy are traversed and understand easier.The first version assumes the physical data structure:
Repository (folder) -> eXAM (folders ) -> SERies (folders) -> Images (files)

For the future versions, all these can be replaced by index files.

## How is it implemented
Unix, Ubuntu file system for image storage.
Mojo (Modular) and Python scripts running on a Windows 10, WSL 1 system.
